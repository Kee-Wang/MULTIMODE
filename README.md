# MULTIMODE

## Indroduction

MULTIMODE is a general code that obtains the ro-vibrational eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the “Watson Hamilonian” using the n-mode representation of the potential.  It has been applied to many polyatomic molecules from triatomics, e.g.,  H2O, tetratomics, e.g., H2CO, HOCO, H2O2, pentatomics, e.g., CH4, and larger molecules, e.g., C2H4, CH3OH, CH3NO2, CH3CHOO.  The approach is based on the VSCF/VCI method, which is in principle “exact”.

# Version Updates

## Introduction

MM has been continuously developed since 1996. Initially MM was code for group research use only. Now the code has been made publicly available since version 5.1.4, thanks to the funding from NSF.

## Public version updates

### ver. 5.1.4 Oct. 8, 2017
The first publicly-avaible version. The package was uploaded to Github with a myrid of supplementary materials to make the MM as user-friendly as possible.


## Important pre-public versions

### ver. 5.1.4
The package is available to deal with linear molecules such as CO2.

### ver. 4.9.0
One of most extensively used stable versions for years in the group. Lots of new features added.

### ver. 3.4
Lots of notes added.




# Ackowledgement

The public version of MULTIMODE has been funded by NSF.

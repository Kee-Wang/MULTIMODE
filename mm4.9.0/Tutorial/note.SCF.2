Test SCF.2
----------
Tests the calculation of the ten lowest-energy J=0 SCF states, using Normal
Modes supplied by the user.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ISCFCI = 0 forces `multimode' along the required SCF route.
MCHECK > 0 transforms equilibrium geometry to principle axis system
INORM  = 0 indicates Normal Modes to be supplied by the user.
NPOT   = NMODE (suggested `book-keeping' value...see below...parameter ignored)
NSTAT  < 0 produces SCF calculations for |NSTAT| states.

Remarks
-------
The lowest 10 (NSTAT = -10) SCF hartree product functions are determined from
a knowledge of the values of `omega' supplied by the user (INORM = 0).  
These 10 SCF states are then determined to a tolerance of CONV = 1.D-2 cm-1, 
for a maximum of ICOUPL = 3-mode coupling of the potential in internal 
coordinates (IWHICH > 0).

For potentials in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0), the parameter NPOT
is allocated by `multimode' to the number of Normal Modes of the system (see
Manual for the use of NATOM and NOTTR to define the number of modes (NMODE)), 
and is ignored on input.

When the Normal Modes are supplied by the user (INORM = 0), the NPOT values of 
`omega' input as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT are included in the input parameters.  Also, 
when the Normal Modes are supplied by the user (INORM = 0), the NORMAL 
COORDINATE DISPLACEMENTS are included in the input parameters.

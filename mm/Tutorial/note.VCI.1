Test VCI.1
----------
Tests the matrix size of CI mixing of 1, 2, 3 coupled modes in a selective
virtual basis.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ICI    < 0 selects VCI option.
NMAX   < 0 constructs the selective CI basis.
MATSIZ > 0 calculate the size of CI matrix and terminate
MAXSUM     maximum sums of quanta for selective basis.
MAXBAS     maximum quanta for selective basis.

Remarks
-------
The VCI matrix is constructed from 1-, 2-, 3-mode coupled zpe virtual functions
(NMAX = -3).  The maximum sum of quanta in the 1-mode, 2-mode, 3-mode bases is
3 (MAXSUM(1) = MAXSUM(2) = MAXSUM(3) = 3).  For each mode, the maximum quantum
in the 1-mode basis is 3 (MAXBAS(1,1) = ... = MAXBAS(NMODE,1) = 3).  For each
mode, the maximum quantum in the 2-mode basis is 2 (MAXBAS(1,2) = ... =
MAXBAS(NMODE,2) = 2).  For each mode, the maximum quantum in the 3-mode basis 
is 1 (MAXBAS(1,3) = ... = MAXBAS(NMODE,3) = 1).

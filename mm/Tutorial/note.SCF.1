Test SCF.1
----------
Tests the calculation of the ten lowest-energy J=0 SCF states, using Normal
Modes determined by `multimode'.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ISCFCI = 0 forces `multimode' along the required SCF route.
MCHECK > 0 transforms equilibrium geometry to principle axis system
INORM  > 0 indicates Normal Modes to be constructed by `multimode'.
NPOT   = 0 (suggested `book-keeping' value...see below...parameter ignored)
NSTAT  < 0 produces SCF calculations for |NSTAT| states.

Remarks
-------
The lowest 10 (NSTAT = -10) SCF hartree product functions are determined from
a knowledge of the values of `omega' resulting from the Normal Mode analysis
(INORM > 0).  These 10 SCF states are then determined to a tolerance of
CONV = 1.D-2 cm-1, for a maximum of ICOUPL = 3-mode coupling of the potential
in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0).

For potentials in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0), the parameter NPOT
is allocated by `multimode' to the number of Normal Modes of the system (see
Manual for the use of NATOM and NOTTR to define the number of modes), and is
ignored on input, although an input value of NPOT = 0 is suggested...see below.

When using the Normal Mode facility (INORM > 0), the NPOT values of `omega'
input as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT are omitted from the input parameters.  Also, when
using the Normal Mode facility (INORM > 0), the NORMAL COORDINATE
DISPLACEMENTS are omitted from the input parameters.
